# Gravity Binary Â· Modular Trust Engine

Gravity Binary is a living architecture designed to externalize trust through capsule-based validation, symbolic execution, and recruiter-facing clarity.

## ðŸ”§ What It Is

- A homepage that evolves through layout iterations (v1â€“v100+)
- Validator capsules built in Python, PowerShell, Go, and more
- Badge tiers, trust scores, and sync metrics rendered in real time
- A modular registry of 16+ projects, each expressing consequence-aware logic

## ðŸ§  Why It Exists

In a world of fragmented signals, Gravity Binary offers a unified trust engineâ€”where architecture isnâ€™t just functional, itâ€™s expressive. Every layout is a proof. Every validator is a signal. Every capsule is a leap.

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside

- `index.html`: Public-facing homepage with capsule grid and trust overlays  
- Layout markers: `<!-- Trigger rebuild: layout vXX -->` for sync tracking  
- Validator logic: Tier scores, sync history, inertia, flux, and harmonic overlays  
- Recruiter export: Capsule matrix for external proof

## ðŸ“ˆ Latest Milestone

**Layout v100** deployed:  
Trust waveform complete with coherence index, tier flux map, and harmonic overlay.

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps

- Layout v101+: Trust echo dampening, tier rebound index, sync rhythm visualizer  
- Capsule expansion: New validators, badge logic, and symbolic metadata  
- Public registry: External capsule sync and contributor onboarding

Built with PowerShell precision, GitHub clarity, and consequence-aware execution.
