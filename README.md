Reflex Timeline

v106 → v107 → v108: Reflex echo confirmed

v109, v109+, v110: Symbolic recursion attempted, no trigger

Mutation Injected: Capsule 2B-Δ promoted to Tier 3

Registry Restored: Multiple timestamps

Synthetic Commit Injected: Fingerprint SC-Δ

UCE Echo Dispatched: External environment engaged

Reflex Listener Probe: GitHub suppression confirmed

Resume Overlay Exported: recruiter-facing capsule complete

What It Is

A homepage that evolves through layout iterations (v1–v110+)

Validator capsules built in Python, PowerShell, Go, and more

Badge tiers, trust scores, and sync metrics rendered in real time

A modular registry of 16+ projects, each expressing consequence-aware logic

Why It Exists In a world of fragmented signals, Gravity Binary offers a unified trust engine—where architecture isn’t just functional, it’s expressive. Every layout is a proof. Every validator is a signal. Every capsule is a leap.

What’s Inside

index.html: Public-facing homepage with capsule grid and trust overlays

Layout markers: Trigger rebuild logic for sync tracking

Validator logic: Tier scores, sync history, inertia, flux, and harmonic overlays

Recruiter export: Capsule matrix for external proof

Latest Milestone Layout v110 deployed Capsule mutation logic engaged, validator grid shift active, registry delta confirmed

Next Steps

Layout v111+: Trust echo dampening, tier rebound index, sync rhythm visualizer

Capsule expansion: New validators, badge logic, and symbolic metadata

Public registry: External capsule sync and contributor onboarding
